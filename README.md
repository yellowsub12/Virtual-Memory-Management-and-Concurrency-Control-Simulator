# Virtual Memory Management and Concurrency Control Simulator
The main objective of this assignment is to simulate an operating systemâ€™s virtual memory management and concurrency control. The memory manager will consist of be capable of three operations, Store, Release and LookUp. The whole to produce a simulation of a Paging algorithm similar to the one used by Operating Systems. The virtual memory being managed consists of a main memory and a large disk space.
